This project includes the .xml files as model files in UPPAAL SMC. To operate the model files, the latest version of UPPAAL tool should be installed in the computer. You may download the tool here: http://www.uppaal.org/ . When using the verifier during verification, set Probability uncertainty to 0.01 (in Options-Statistical parameters) to ensure enough runs of traces for the estimation of probability.
